This is a simple shell project. It allows users to execute basic commands such as cd, ls, pwd, echo, and others.

How to Use Simple Shell:

To run this program, compile the code using gcc compiler below:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

Run the executable by typing the following command:

./hsh
